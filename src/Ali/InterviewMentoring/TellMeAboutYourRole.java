            Tell me about your role?

                I am currently automation tester in my team.

                    I am running the smoke test every day morning if it is fail because of application then I let my team
                    know about this , if it is failed because of the automation then I fix my automation script.

                    Also I am running the regression test as well before every release (every 3 sprints).
                    I am performing multiple test types as well. smoke test , regression ,black box , integration ,
                    functional test.

                    I am participating the agile meetings like sprint planning , review(demo) , daily stand up, grooming,
                    retro.

                    I am using jira as bug tracking tool. If I find a defect I am creating it in the jira, when developer
                    fix it. I retest that defect if it is fail I am recreating(reopenning) the defect. if it pass  then
                    I close it.

                    I am cross functional team member if other members need help then I am helping to achieve our sprint goal.

                    That pretty much about my role in the current team.
