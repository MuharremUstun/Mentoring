        What is abstract class?
            This is a class in java.
              If I want my child classes have some methods then I can make my class as abstract
              And make the methods as abstract too.

           1) make the class as abstract
           2) extend the parent class
           3) in the parent class make the methods as abstract

           Rules:
               Abstract
                    1) I can have a abstract method and also non abstract methods.
                    2) To make method abstract we need to mention abstract keyword.
                    3) I can create a constructor.
                    4) I can create final and non-final variables

               Interface
                    1) All methods are abstract basically no body
                    2) I dont need to mention the method as abstract.
                    3) I can NOT use an constructor.
                    4) All variables are final.
