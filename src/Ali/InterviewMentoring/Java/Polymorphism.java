       What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic Polymorphism?
            OVERLOADING => STATIC
            OVERRIDING => DYNAMIC


            Overloading vs Overriding?
                Overloading --> Overloading is happen in one class.
                I have multiple methods names are same but parameters should have different type or count .
                I can change the return type.
                I can overload final,static and private methods.

                Overriding --> Should have parent and child relationship (Multiple classes)
                I have multiple methods names are same parameter also should be same.
                I can not change the return type.
                I can not override final,static and private methods.


       What is Polymorphism?
            Polymorphism is ability of one object to act multiple forms.

                WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

                And there are two types of polymorphism one is runtime and the other one is dynamic polymorphism.

                For the rest look at the first question.
