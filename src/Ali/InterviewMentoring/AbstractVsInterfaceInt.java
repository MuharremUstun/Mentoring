     	Abstract vs Interface?

                Abstract:
                    I am using extends keyword to call abstract class from the child
                    Abstract class can have abstract method and non abstract method
                    Abstract can have the constructor
                    I can create a regular variable and final variables

                Interface:
                    I am using implements keyword to call interface from the child
                    Interface just a abstract methods.
                    Interface can NOT have the constructor
                    Interface variables are final
