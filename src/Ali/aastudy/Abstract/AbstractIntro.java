        Why we need a abstract
           An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override.
           Abstract similar to inheritance
           Using extends keyword
           Parent child relationship


        Abstract has
            Abstract method
                Abstract method does not have a body.
                Child classes SHOULD have the abstract methods in the parent class.

        Rules:
            Abstract class can have abstract method and non-abstract method.
            Abstract class can have a regular variable and final variable.
            Abstract class can have a constructor.

    /*
        Example for the variable and constructor

          int number;
          final int number2 = 60;

      public AbstractIntro(int number , int number2){
        this.number = number;
