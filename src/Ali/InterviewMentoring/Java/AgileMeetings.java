    1)	Which meetings are you attending in the agile? What are you guys talking about?

            Sprint planning:
                Basially we are reading the all the userstories and also acceptance creataria if any one in the team
                has a questoin we are discussing in that meeting.

              Assigning the user stories to Developers (Scrum master do this )

                Who is joinning: BA , PO , Dev team (Dev , QA)
                How it is taking : max 1 hour (2 weeks sprint)

            Sprint daily stand up:
                What did I do yesterday , What I am going to do today , in there any blockers.

            Sprint review - demo :

                Note : for example we have 10 user story in that sprint and my team is finished 8 of them.

                Developers are sharing their screen and showing what they have done.

                For QA: For 10 user story I have 20 test case and 16 of them is passing and 4 of them is not passing

            Sprint retro:

                What we have done good in this sprint and what we need to improve for the future sprints.

                Good: We collabrated well between QA and dev.
                      Offshore (Working from india)


                 Improve:  When I start working in my team there was no QA column and
                 I told them to create one so I can understand Developer finish their
                 job and I can start test that user story.

            Sprint grooming:
                We are as a team giving a point to user stories and when we get the user story from backlog to sprint
                it help us to calculate how many user stories we need to get.


            what do you do when there is nothing to test? or there is always something to test?
                I am writing the test cases (positive and negative) to make sure when the user story come to QA I know what
              to test so it is not taking to much time for QA.
