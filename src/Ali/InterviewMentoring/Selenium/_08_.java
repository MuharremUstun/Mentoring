    /*
         How do you decide to use xpath or css locator?

            First I would like to choose css because css is faster
                but there is some situations where css is not working

                    1) Css is not able to find the text
                    2) Css is not able to find the parent from the child.


        How do you handle dynamic elements?

                Dynamic element is changing the attribute value each run (id , class).

                id = 'Login1234.000' <-- id is changing but Login is same every time.

        answer-->     I am using start-with , ends-with or contains.
