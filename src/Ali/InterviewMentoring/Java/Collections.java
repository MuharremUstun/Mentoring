    2)	Array vs ArrayList

          Array:
          1) Array is a fixed size
          2) Array is faster
          3) Array has a 2D array
          4) Array is NOT  part of the collections
          5) Array can contain primitives and objects

          ArrayList:
          1) Arraylist is a dynamic
          2) Araylist is slower
          3) ArrayList has a just one dimension
          4) Arraylist is part of the collections
          5) ArrayList can contain just an objects.


    3)	Arraylist vs set
        Arraylist can have a duplicate value
        Set can not have a duplicate value

        Arraylist can store multiple null values
        Set can contain single null value (Except tree set)

        Arraylist first in first out
        Set has multiple ways to print (LinkedHasset , Treeset , HasSet )

        To get the data from the Arraylist I can use .get method
        To get the date from the Set I can NOT use .get method (need to use for  each loop )



    4)	ArrayList vs Map
            Arraylist is just containing the values
            Map is contain key and value pair

            Arraylist is FIFO
            Map has a different type of ordering (Linked hash map , Hashmap , TreeMap)

            Arraylist use add method
            Map is using put method

                Map key doesnt allow duplicates
                Valus allow duplicates

                Arraylist allow duplicate
