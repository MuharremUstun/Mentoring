           What are your daily activities (What do you do when you are going to work) (Daily routine) All same question?
                I am going to work around 8:45 am and checking smoke test result and also my emails , calander.
                Then 9 am I am attending daily stand up meeting in this meeting we are talking about.
                What did you do yesterday , what you going to do today and is there any blockers.
                    If there is a failure in the smoke test then I am mentioning in the meeting.
                After the daily standup.
                    It depends on my sprint.
                        If we just started the sprint then I have sprint planning meeting.
                              After the sprint planning meeting I am creating the test cases about those user stories.

                        If we are middle of the sprint then I am testing the User stories.

                        If we are end of the sprint I am attanding the sprint review(demo) and sprint retro meeting.

                        Rest of the time I am working on the automating the regression test cases.

               Smoke test: Smoke test is the test type and it is making sure application is working.
               Make sure environment is up and application is working.
               It is usually taking around 10-20 min.
               Checking around 5-10 functionality.


           NOTE: Environments , Smoke test regression test .
