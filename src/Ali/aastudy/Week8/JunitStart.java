        Why we need Junit?

        Testing is the process of checking the functionality of an application to ensure it runs as per requirements.
        Unit testing comes into picture at the developersâ€™ level; it is the testing of single entity (class or method).
        Unit testing plays a critical role in helping a software company deliver quality products to its customers.

        We need to test our code to make is it working as expected or not.
