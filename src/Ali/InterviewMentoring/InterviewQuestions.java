                Answer: How many years experience I have.
                        Which tools I am using--> testNG, cucumber,java,selenium, sql,
                                                    restAssured libraries.
                                                    Personality.

            2) How do you do database testing?

                I am creating a citizenship and get the data from database make us it is created

                    Usually testers doesn not have a create and delete function in the database.


            3) Tell me your challenge with a dev team or business team?

                Developer does not ID attribute so I asked them to created the ID attribute.
                User story does not have a description or acceptance criteria.

                I asked to team to have some happy hours so we will spend more time
                    together and it help us to better communication.


            4)Have you ever created framework from scratch and
                Which technologies did you used and why?

                    4.1)Can you tell me about your current framework?
                    4.2)What kind of framework you can create?

              I am using selenium with java.
              Maven for project management tool.
                    It helps me to organize my dependencies.

              I use BDD-Page object model framework.
               I am using BDD basically cucumber because every steps in cucumber feature files
                  are reusable so I can write less code and I can test more functionalities.

               POM(page object..) for creating each elements once in my project so
                if we make a changes then it is easier and faster to update the project.

                My team used to have testng report which has just scenario is failed or
                       passed

                But after I join I added extends report so it is showing us. How many
                    scenarios passed and failed or skipped.

               I create a runner classes with runner class I can run multiple feature files.


               5)Project manager asked to you run all regression and you dont have a
                enough time and how you can solve it?

                I have a regression runner and I have a tag in the runner as well
                    for example regression tag.

                       I will add these tags to scenarious which I would like to run
                       so in this way I can run my regrssion in one time(I can run it over night).

                5)What do you do if regression automation scenario fails?
                    First I will run them in automation as well.
                    If it still fails.
                        I will try to do this scenario in manual.

                        If application has a defect I am creating a defect in jira.
                        If it is passing manual I am fixing the automation code.


                Question 6 Notes)In the basqar we have a user story which is adding an input to create fees.
                        Name of the input Description.

                        First developer will create a description input
                        Then Tester will test the user story in manual.

                6) When do you do automation? in the sprint or after the sprint?
                       1) I am working in the sprint after the user story done then I am going to automate.
                            After testing in manual.

                Recommended 2)  After sprint ends I am changing automation script. Because in the sprint we might have
                    some defects and also some user stories are huge so after all changes done and make sure functionalities
                    are working as expected then I am working in automation.


                7) We do not have a automation now. What is the steps you will take before starting automation?
                        Which tools you will use how to decide it?

                    First I would like to use Java selenium framework and also I am working with BDD page object model.
                       I use BDD-Page object model framework.
                       I am using BDD basically cucumber because every steps in cucumber feature files
                          are reusable so I can write less code and I can test more functionalities.

                       POM(page object..) for creating each elements once in my project so
                        if we make a changes then it is easier and faster to update the project.

                    These are tools I would like to use but if the company required different tools that is okay to me
                        I can learn new tools and languages.


                    I am going to create a word document for estimations and tools(I can add tool description).
                        In the first month we are able to finish.
                            10%
                        In the second month we are able to finish.
                            21%
                        In the third month we are able to finish.
                            35%


                8) We have 1000 test cases which one you will start?

                        If there is a captca selenium can not automate it.
                        Voice record video selenium can not automate it.

                        I would like to start with the pages which is reusable, used by users mostly.


                9) What do you do after the sprint planing? Talk about your week?

                      1)  Because I have a other QA which is mostly working with manual testing.
                            He is start creating the test cases.

                            And I am start working on the user stories which from the previous sprint.

                      2)  In my current team I am the only QA.
                            After the sprint planning I am creating the test cases.
                                After test case creating is done then I am start working on the Automation.

                           In my team developers are also helping me for testing in case if I need an help they can also help me.
