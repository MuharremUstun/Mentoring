           Overloading vs overriding?
                   Overloading
                        1) In the overloading method name should be same parameter type or count should be different
                        2) Return type can be different
                        3) Overloading in the same class
                        4) I can overload final,static and private methods.

                   Overriding
                        1) In the overriding method name should be same parameter type or count should be same
                        2) Return type should be same
                        3) Overriding has a parent and child relationship
                        4) I can NOT override final,static and private methods.
