        What is defect?
            When the application functionalities not working as expected.

            Expected result vs actual result is not matching.

        1)	What do you do when you find a defect?

                First I am making sure it is a valid defect I am doing the scenario couple times.
             I am talking with other QA to make sure it is a defect.
             Then I am talking with developer and after our discussion(if developer agree with me )
             Then I am creating a defect in Jira.

        2)	How do you handle the conflict with the developer?

                Before I talk with developer, I am making sure it is a valid defect. I have a screenshots
             expected result actual result. I have a discussion with developer if he is NOT agree with me
             then BA is sitting next to us and we are asking to her. She decides is this a defect or not.
             If she said it is a defect then I am creating defect in Jira else I am not.


        3)	What is Defect life cycle?

         I am creating new defect > developer is working on it (fixing) > Retest the defect (QA) > Close(if fixed)

         I am creating new defect > developer is working on it (fixing) > Retest the defect (QA) > if fail

         > developer is working on it(fixing) > Retest the defect(QA) > closed(if fixed)
